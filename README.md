# Direcotry structure
`data`, `api` directories simulates a database; `api` contains several php files that get or update the files from `data` directory;
`layouts` contains files that are just sections of HTML to prevent code duplication
`assets` contains css & javascript files; typically this directory is public

# Notes
1. This project was built in ~6-8h; 
2. There are several functions that were built using ChatGPT
3. The `Sabloane` page is not completed, lots of improvements can be done, like adding data interval validation, more complex time&date interval
4. The `Rapoarte` page will not be completed, I believe the main focus is on the `Sabloane` and I already spent few hours
5. Hope you appreciate my work and keep in mind that I did it as demo - lots of things may be missing ofc.
